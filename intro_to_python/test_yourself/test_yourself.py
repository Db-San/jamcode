The second solution is to type your array more precisely,
and insist that it must contain either all ints or all floats,
disallowing a mixture of the two. We can do so using
TypeVars with value restrictions:

Code
from typing import Union, List, TypeVar 

# Note: The informal convention is to prefix all typevars with
# either 'T' or '_T' -- so 'TNum' or '_TNum'.

def quick_sort(arr: List[TNum]) -> List[TNum]:
    return arr

foo = [1, 2, 3, 4]  # type: List[int]
quick_sort(foo)

bar = [1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0]  # type: List[float]
quick_sort(foo)
This will also prevent us from accidentally "mixing"
types like we had up above.

I would recommend using the second approach
-- it's a bit more precise, and will prevent
you from losing information about the exact
type a list contains as you pass it through
your quicksort function.

The names for the word and words variables here
should be swapped, at the very least. 
Though I'd even call them args and arg, maybe.
clarity please; this is not the tutorial. this is real irl code)
besides that, looks good to me.

As for the sum of squares, maybe specify 
the element type of numbers, if you know it?
Besides it, looks great.

Never one to hold a grudge, I share those midterm questions with youâ€¦
see if you can do better than I did freshman year.

1a. (MIT-Scheme) Using the function
Implement sum-of-squares, which calculates the 
sum of squares of a list, for example:

(sum-of-squares '(1 2 3 4 5))
should evaluate to 55.
'''

TNum = TypeVar('TNum', int, float)
def add_sum_of_squares(arr: List[TNum]) -> List[TNum]:
    arr = sum(int(number)**2 for number in numbers)
    return arr

numbers = list(range(1, 6))
print(numbers)
print(add_sum_of_squares(numbers))
