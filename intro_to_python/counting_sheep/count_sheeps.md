# Notes - count_sheeps.py

If you want to know how many times
a substring appears within a string,
you can use the count() method.

Example demo code:

```python
# Credits: @Simon.1
def count_sheeps(sheep):
  return sheep.count(True)
```

## Comments

I hadn't considered that! I knew
count() before but decided to the
good ol'for loop hacky solution.

A simple .count() function was
enough to solve the problem.
Pretty clever I must say the least.
Main takeway is try to use a built-in
method or implementation if available
before resorting to hacking your own
solution.
