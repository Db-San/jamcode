Never one to hold a grudge, I share those midterm questions with youâ€¦
see if you can do better than I did freshman year.

1a. (MIT-Scheme) Using the function
Implement sum-of-squares, which calculates the 
sum of squares of a list, for example:

(sum-of-squares '(1 2 3 4 5))
should evaluate to 55.

# Sum of squaresin python
def add_sum_of_squares(numbers):
    number = sum(int(number)**2 for number in numbers)

# Sum of Squares should evaulate this to 55
print("sum of squares: ")
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
print(numbers)
