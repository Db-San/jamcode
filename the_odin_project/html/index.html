    <h1>This is a heading 1</h1>

    <h2>Paragraphs</h2>
    <p>
        Using the correct level of heading is important as levels provide a hierarchy to the content.
        An h1 heading should always be used for the heading of the overall page, and the lower level
        headings should be used as the headings for content in smaller sections of the page.

    <p>
      If we want to create paragraphs in HTML, we need to use the
      paragraph element, which will add a newline after each of
      our paragraphs. A paragraph element is defined by wrapping
      text content with a p tag.

    <h2>Headings</h2>
    <p>
      The element <strong>strong, will make a text bold</strong>.
      It also semantically <strong>text as important;</strong> this
      affects tools, like screen readers, that
      users with visual impairments will rely on 
      to use your website. 
      
      The tone of voice on some screen readers 
      <strong>will change</strong> communicate the importance 
      of the text <strong>within</strong> a strong element. 
      To define a strong element we wrap text content in a tag.

      The <em> element makes text italic. It also semantically places emphasis on the text, which again may affect things like screen readers. To define an emphasised element we wrap text content in a <em> tag.
    </p>
To use <em> on its own:

  </body>
