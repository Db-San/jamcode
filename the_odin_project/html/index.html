        Using the correct level of heading is important as levels provide a hierarchy to the content.
        An h1 heading should always be used for the heading of the overall page, and the lower level
        headings should be used as the headings for content in smaller sections of the page.

      If we want to create paragraphs in HTML, we need to use the
      paragraph element, which will add a newline after each of
      our paragraphs. A paragraph element is defined by wrapping
      text content with a p tag.
