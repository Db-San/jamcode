Donations
Since I'm getting asked about this on regular basis, there is
no donation button on this page.

The main reason is that I feel that the donation system doesn't
actually help software development and worse, can be
guilt-inducing for users who choose not to donate.

Instead, I think that "mécénat"; or developer patronage,
from companies
which benefit most from a healthy FLOSS ecosystem, is
what we should be aiming for.

This is because, unless they are backed by a company, developers who
want to provide quality Open Source software cannot realistically
sustain full time development, no matter how generous their software
users are.

Also, unless you are blocking them (hint, hint), you'll notice
that there are ads on this page, which I consider sufficient
revenue enough.

Finally the fact that I have the freedom to develop Free Software
in my spare time should indicate that I'm well-off enough,
and therefore that you should direct your generosity towards
people who need it a lot more than I do. If you really insist, you
can always make a donation to the Free Software Foundation,
as they are the main reason software like Rufus is possible.

At any rate, I'll take this opportunity to say thank you for you
continuing support and enthusiasm about this little program:

it is much appreciated!

But please continue to feel free to use Rufus without any
guilt about not contributing for it financially – 

you should never have to!
