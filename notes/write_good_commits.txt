How to write good commit messages

Using VSCode as your text editor
    (you should have set this up in the Git Basics section)
    will allow you to easily make multi-line commit messages,
    easily see the character length of each line,
    and will allow you to use VSCode spell
    check extensions to make sure your
    spelling is correct

Use an active voice: 
    “Fix card generator”
Avoid using vague commit messages such as
    “saved”
    or “updated”
    as well as "upload"

Commit early and often!
