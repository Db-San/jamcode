Tips: 
If you want to know how many times
a substring appears within a string,
you can use the count() method.

Example:

    def count_sheeps(sheep):    
      return sheep.count(True)

Notes:
I didn't thought of that! That was clever.
First, try to use a built-in method if it
exists, then you can hack in your own
method. 

Don't forget the DRY principle.
